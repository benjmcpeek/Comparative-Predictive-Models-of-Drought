Draft Problem Statement 

Ongoing global climate change patterns in temperature, precipitation, soil quality and erosion, land use, and habitat destruction have made predicting crop yields all the more precarious. Given these environmental factors, how can we more accurately predict whether a country is likely to see an unprecedented change in crop yields or enter a famine?
Modern methods of predicting crop yields now have accuracies of up to 96% - 98% by using satellite data and advanced modeling. (source) These methods are costly and difficult to produce on a mass scale. (soure_2) Our models focus on using accessible data and being reproducible globally. We will determine that our models are successful if our accuracy meets within 5% under the modern methods (96%).
