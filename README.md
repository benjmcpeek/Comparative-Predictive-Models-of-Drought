## Overview

The series of notebooks, data files, data visual images, and slideshow presentation contained herein include multiple machine learning models intended to improve drought predictions from a variety of datasets and modeling approachs. The task of developing a social impact model collectively was generated by General Assembly (GA), but the choice of datasets, problem statement, data collection methods, data analysis and visualization, machine learning models and iterations, and ultimate agency recommendations represent the expertise and opinions of the authors. The following README file contains an executive summary of the problem statement, data collection methods and sources, summary of final production models, and recommendations presented before California State Water Resources Board.

## Problem Statement

The California Department of Water Resources has hired a team of data scientists to develop comparative machine learning models for predicting upcoming droughts. The effects of global climate change have made it increasingly challenging to predict when a drought may be looming on the horizon but all the more imperative as more extreme weather events occur with increasing frequency.

The team of data scientists want to know:

**Which predictive model is the best indicator** of whether a drought is likely to occur **given historical weather, climate, and satillite image data? Does one model perform better** than any other in predicting drought or drought-like conditions for the state of California to declare forecasts of droughts more accurately?

The team of data scientists will use **three different models from three different datasets**, all employing different assumptions regarding risk of drought and all employing slightly different metrics to evaluate effectiveness. The team will then present its findings and make recommendations to the State Water Resources Board about how to best anticipate droughts for emergency preparedness.

## Data & Modeling Methods


#### Model 1 Datatset

The first dataset was collected from **include source here** and scraped by **explain scraping and cleaning methods here**. These data were used to create a **insert model type here** which was evaluated using **insert evaluation metric here**. For the reader's convenience this dataset's data dictionary is shown below:

#### Model 2 Datatset

The second dataset was collected from a Kaggle Wildfire Prediction Dataset [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset?select=train). The original dataset was compiled by the Kaggle contributor from Canada's government website, sourced from the government and municipalities of Quebec, which compiled images primarily from southern Quebec, dating back to 1976 [source](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9d8f219c-4df0-4481-926f-8a2a532ca003). The image dataset was scanned for and removed any corrupted files. These data were used to create a **binary image classification convolutional neural network** which was evaluated using **accuracy**. A data dictionary is not provided for this dataset, as it is a directory of labeled jpg images contained within this git repository. The reader will find more information on this dataset of image in the exploratory data analysis and image preprocessing in Model 2.


#### Model 3 Datatset

The third dataset was collected from **include source here** and scraped by **explain scraping and cleaning methods here**. These data were used to create a **insert model type here** which was evaluated using **insert evaluation metric here**. For the reader's convenience this dataset's data dictionary is shown below:

## Summary of Findings

Three different models were developed to predict drought from three different perspectives.

1. Model 1 predicted precipitation forecasting **prediction** according to **this metric**.
2. Model 2 predicted whether an image shows a wildfire region with 95% accuracy.
3. Model 3 predicted soil moisture forecasting **prediction** acording to **this metric**.

Based on the performance of these three models and the assumptions and limitations inherent in each of the models, the team of data scientists inferred that **Model X** and **Model Y** might be the most suitable for making accurate forecasting predictions of drought.

## Agency Recommendations

Based on the highest performing models, we recommend the following:

* Recommendation 1
* Satellite image classification is very promising given its high accuracy. The State Water Resources Board should invest in training multi-class models on labeled drought images to anticipate potential drought severity in the future.
* Recommendation 3
